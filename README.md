# Predicting Cross Country Content Spread

Project Overview:

This project investigates whether linguistic similarity between nations (shared languages and linguistic proximity) influences the international spread of digital content. By combining trending data from the YouTube Data API with linguistic indices from the DICL Database, the study builds a predictive model to determine if a video popular in one country will "cross over" and trend in another.

Tech Stack:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier
- Data Collection: YouTube Data API
- Visualization & Analysis: Matplotlib, Seaborn
